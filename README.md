Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Application
This project is an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that integrates cutting-edge technologies to deliver precise and contextually relevant responses. The frontend interface is built with Gradio, providing an intuitive and seamless user experience for interacting with the AI model. The backend leverages ChromaDB, a powerful vector database, to efficiently store and retrieve high-dimensional embeddings. By utilizing cosine similarity for vector-based search, the system ensures highly accurate retrieval of relevant documents or information.

At the core of the application is Hugging Face's Mistral model, which generates high-quality text embeddings and facilitates the generation of coherent and contextually appropriate responses. To further enhance the accuracy and relevance of the retrieved results, a reranking step is performed using Cohere AI. This reranking mechanism fine-tunes the final output, ensuring that users receive the most pertinent information based on their queries.

By combining the strengths of Gradio, ChromaDB, Hugging Face, and Cohere AI, this RAG application exemplifies the power of modern AI in creating robust, scalable, and intelligent systems. Whether for research, customer support, or knowledge management, this solution is designed to meet the demands of complex and dynamic information retrieval tasks.
